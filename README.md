#Project Objective

This project implements a simplified Retail Analytics System that processes retail transaction data and generates business insights.

The system:

Ingests and cleans raw sales data

Stores validated data in a relational database

Calculates customer loyalty points

Performs customer segmentation (RFM-based)

Applies basic predictive analytics

Generates analytical dashboards

The architecture is modular, scalable, and designed for clarity and maintainability.

🗄️ Database Design

We use SQLite (retail.db) as a relational database.

Core Tables

stores – Store information

products – Product catalog & stock

customer_details – Customer & loyalty data

store_sales_header – Transaction summary

store_sales_line_items – Product-level sales

promotion_details – Promotion rules

loyalty_rules – Loyalty calculation logic

Design Approach

Normalized relational schema

Primary & foreign key relationships

Separation of transactional and master data

Designed to support analytics queries efficiently

🔄 ETL Strategy

The ETL pipeline is modular and divided into three steps:

1️⃣ Ingestion

Reads CSV files from data/raw

Converts into structured dataframes

2️⃣ Validation

Performs:

Null checks

Negative value checks

Special character cleaning

Datatype validation

Basic integrity checks

Invalid records are handled separately.

3️⃣ Loading

Loads cleaned data into retail.db

Supports reusable and incremental data loads

This ensures high data quality before analytics execution.

🎯 Loyalty & Segmentation
Loyalty Logic

Points assigned based on spend rules

Bonus points applied using thresholds

Stored in customer_details.total_loyalty_points

RFM Segmentation

Recency (days since last purchase)

Frequency (number of transactions)

Monetary (total spend)

Segments:

HS – High Spender

AR – At Risk

📊 Predictive Analytics

Includes simple business-rule-based predictions:

Next month spend estimation

Stock-out risk detection

Promotion response sensitivity

No complex ML — logic-driven as per scope.

📈 Dashboard

Built using Matplotlib.

Includes:

Total sales by store

Top selling products

Loyalty distribution
